There was a problem with date formatting since it did have AM/PM in it. However here all hours were the same 
that is why I just deleted the AM/PM in the Notepad++ and change formatting from 4/12/2016 to 4-12-2016, so that
SQL in Bigquery didn't have a problem recognizing the date as a timestamp.
